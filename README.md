# Cyber‑Attacks Detection on Web Applications Using Machine Learning

A project that aims to detect cyber‑attacks targeting web applications using machine learning techniques. The objective is to classify or detect malicious behaviour (such as SQL injection) and help enhance web application security.

## 🧐 Overview

This repository contains code and resources for detecting web application attacks using ML. Some specific attack types (e.g. SQL Injection) are considered.  

Technologies used include HTML (for web or interface parts), Python (for ML model training, prediction, etc.), and possibly SQL or web‑related scripts.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SohiniSangoju/Cyber‑Attacks‑Detection‑on‑Web‑Applications‑Using‑Machine‑Learning.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory.

3. Install dependencies (assuming Python is used). For example:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Prepare the dataset: preprocess, clean, split into training / test sets.

5. Train the model:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

6. Use the model to predict / detect attacks:
```bash
python detect_attack.py --input <some_input_data>
```

(Adjust file names as per actual scripts).

## 🎯 Features

- 🔍 Detect web attacks (e.g. SQL injection) using machine learning  
- 🧹 Preprocessing and feature extraction from request/input data  
- 🧠 Classification into “safe” vs “attack” / “malicious” vs “benign”

## 🔧 Possible Improvements & Enhancements

- ➕ Expand attack types (e.g. Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF, File Inclusion, etc.)  
- 📈 Gather more data for better generalization  
- 🧪 Try different ML / Deep Learning models (e.g. Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks)  
- ⏱️ Implement real‑time detection (e.g. via middleware or proxy)  
- 📊 Add evaluation metrics (e.g. precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves)  
- 🖥️ Create a dashboard/UI to show predictions or logs  
- 🚀 Automate deployment (e.g. integrate with web server or API)  
- ⚙️ Enhance data preprocessing and handle imbalanced datasets
